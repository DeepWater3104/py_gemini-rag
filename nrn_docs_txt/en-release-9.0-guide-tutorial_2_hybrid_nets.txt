Tutorial 2 : Making Hybrid Nets

Outline

Example of a hybrid network
Step 1. Define the types of cells
We need a class of cells that can supply afferent spikes.
We need a “motoneuron” or “M cell” class.
Specifying the anatomical and biophysical properties of the M cell class
Specifying what kinds of synapses can be attached to an M cell
Placing synapses on the M cell
Step 2. Create each cell in the network
We need a Network Builder
We need an instance of each of our three cell types.
Step 3. Connect the cells.
Network architecture
Parameters
Run a simulation and plot the input and output spike trains
