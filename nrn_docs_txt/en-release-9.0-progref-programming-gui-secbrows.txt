Python
Syntax:
sb
=
n.SectionBrowser()
sb
=
n.SectionBrowser(SectionList)
Description:
Class that makes a visible list of all section names.
If the optional SectionList arg is present then only those
section names are shown in the browser.
Example:
from
neuron
import
n
,
gui
soma
=
n
.
Section
(
'soma'
)
dend
=
n
.
Section
(
'dend'
)
sl
=
n
.
SectionList
([
soma
])
# only the soma will be shown

Python
Syntax:
.select(sec=section)
Description:
specified section is highlighted.
Example:

Section
(
'soma'
)
axon
=

HOC
Syntax:
.select()
Description:
currently accessed section is highlighted.
Example:
create soma
create axon
objref sb
sb = new SectionBrowser()
axon sb.select()
SectionBrowser.

Python
Syntax:
sb.select_action(python_func)
Description:
A Python function is executed when an item is selected (single click or
dragging) by the mouse. Before execution, the selected section
is pushed. (and popped after the function completes.)
A Python function is executed in the object context in which
select_action
registered it.
Example:
from
neuron
import
n
,
gui
soma
=
n
.
Section
(
'soma'
)
axon
=

HOC
Syntax:
sb.select_action("command")
Description:
Command is executed when an item is selected (single click or
dragging) by the mouse. Before execution, the selected section
is pushed. (and popped after the command completes.)
Command is executed in the object context in which
select_action
registered it.
Example:
begintemplate Cell
    public soma, dend, axon
    create soma, dend[3], axon
endtemplate Cell


objref sb, cell[3]
for i=0,2 cell[i] = new Cell()
sb = new SectionBrowser()
sb.select_action("act()")


proc act() {
    printf("currently accessed section is %s\n", secname())
}
SectionBrowser.
accept_action


Python
Syntax:
sb.accept_action(python_func)
Description:
A Python function is executed when an item is accepted (double click) by
the mouse. Before execution, the selected section
is pushed. (and popped after the function completes.)
A Python function is executed in the object context in which the
accept_action
registered it.
Example:
from
neuron
import
n

gui
soma
=

registered it.
