Warning
For code written in Python, it is generally more practical to use Python string
formatting (e.g., f-strings) and file IO.
Name:
printf, fprint, sprint — formatted output
Syntax:
n.printf(format,
...)
n.fprint(format,
...)
n.sprint(strdef,
format,
...)
Description:
n.printf
places output on the standard output.
n.fprint
places output
on the file opened with the
n.wopen(filename)
command (standard
output if no file is opened).
n.sprint
places output in its
strdef
argument. (Note:
strdef
must be a NEURON string reference, created via
e.g.,
mystr
=
n.ref("")
, not a regular Python string as the latter is immutable.)
These functions are subsets of their counterparts in
the C standard library.
Each of these functions converts, formats, and prints its arguments after
the
format
string under control of the
format
string.
The
format
string contains two types of objects: plain characters which
are simply printed, and conversion specifications
each of which causes conversion and printing of the next
successive argument.
Each conversion specification is introduced by the character ‘
%
‘
and ends with a conversion type specifier.  The type specifiers
supported are:
Between
%
and the conversion type, optional flags, width, precision
and size specifiers can be placed.  The most useful flag is ‘-’ which
left justifies the result, otherwise the number is right justified in its
field. Width and precision specifiers are of the form
width.precis
.
Special characters of note are:
n.printf
and
n.fprint
return the number of characters printed.
Example:
n
.
printf
(
"
\t
pi=
%-20.10g
sin(pi)=
%f
\n
"
,
n
.
PI
,
n
.
sin
(
n
.
PI
))
pi
=
3.141592654
sin
(
pi
)
=
0.000000
42
Pure Python almost equivalent example:
print
(
f
'
\t
pi=
{
n
.
PI
:
<20.10g
}
sin(pi)=
{
n
.
sin
(
n
.
PI
)
:
f
}
'
)
Note
This is not an identical replacement because it does not return the number of characters;
the return is always
None
.

HOC
Name:
printf, fprint, sprint — formatted output
Syntax:
printf(format,
...)
fprint(format,
...)
sprint(string,
format,
...)
Description:
Printf
places output on the standard output.
fprint
places output
on the file opened with the
wopen(filename)
command (standard
output if no file is opened).
Sprint
places output in its
string
argument.  These functions are subsets of their counterparts in
the C standard library.
Each of these functions converts, formats, and prints its arguments after
the
format
string under control of the
format
string.
The
format
string contains two types of objects: plain characters which
are simply printed, and conversion specifications
each of which causes conversion and printing of the next
successive argument.
Each conversion specification is introduced by the character ‘
%
‘
and ends with a conversion type specifier.  The type specifiers
supported are:
f
signed value of the form -dddd.ddddd
e
signed value of the form -d.dddddde-nn
g
signed value in either ‘e’ or ‘f’ form based on given value
and precision.  Trailing zeros and the decimal point are printed
only if necessary.
d
signed value truncated and printed as integer.
o
printed as unsigned octal integer.
x
printed as unsigned hexadecimal integer
c
number treated as ascii code and printed as single character
s
string is printed, arg must be a string.
Between
%
and the conversion type, optional flags, width, precision
and size specifiers can be placed.  The most useful flag is ‘-’ which
left justifies the result, otherwise the number is right justified in its
field. Width and precision specifiers are of the form
width.precis
.
Special characters of note are:
\n
newline
\t
tab
\r
carriage return without the line feed
printf
and
fprint
return the number of characters printed.
Example:
printf("\tpi=%-20.10g sin(pi)=%f\n", PI, sin(PI))
        pi=3.141592654          sin(pi)=0.000000

Redirect Standard Out

hoc_stdout
(
)

Python
Syntax:
n.hoc_stdout("
filename
")
n.hoc_stdout()
Description:
With a filename argument, switches the original standard out to filename.
With no arguments. switches current standard out back to original filename.
Only one level of switching allowed. Switching back to original causes
future output to append to the stdout. Switching to “filename” writes
stdout from the beginning of the file.
Example:
from
neuron
import
n
def
p
():
print
(
'one'
)
# to original standard out
n
.
hoc_stdout
(
'temp.tmp'
)
print
(
'two'
)
# to temp.tmp
for
sec
in
n
.
allsec
():
n
.
psection
(
sec
=
sec
)
# to temp.tmp
n
.
hoc_stdout
()
print
(
'three'
)
# to the original standard out
p
()
Note
Despite the misleading name, this redirects standard out from both Python and HOC.
HOC
Syntax:
hoc_stdout("
filename
")
hoc_stdout()
Description:
With a filename argument, switches the original standard out to filename.
With no arguments. switches current standard out back to original filename.
Only one level of switching allowed. Switching back to original causes
future output to append to the stdout. Switching to “filename” writes
stdout from the beginning of the file.
Example:
proc p() {
    print "one" // to original standard out
        hoc_stdout("temp.tmp")
        print "two" // to temp.tmp
    forall psection() // to temp.tmp
        hoc_stdout()
        print "three" // to original standard out
}
