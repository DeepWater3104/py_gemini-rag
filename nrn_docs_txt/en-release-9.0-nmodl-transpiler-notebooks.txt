About the notebooks

To help you get started we have created several
Jupyter notebooks
, which cover many aspects of using NMODL from Python
beginning from basic model parsing and AST visualization, continuing with using and writing your own AST visitors, and
finally understanding and using the NMODL ODE solvers. You can find the notebooks
here
to run and test yourself.
