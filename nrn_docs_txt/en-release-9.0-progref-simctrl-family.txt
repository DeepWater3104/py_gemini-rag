Family

For several values of a variable, execute an action.
Basically just a form for specifying a for loop.
Usage:
n.makeFamily()
(Python or MATLAB) or
makeFamily()
(HOC)
constructs a Family and maps it to the screen. The Family
instance is destroyed when its window is dismissed.
The slider value ranges from start to end. Due to the length of time it
generally takes to complete an action it is best to use the middle button
to select a value with the slider. Dragging the slider button or using
it too rapidly will cause many action requests to be ignored since a
slider event taking place while handling the previous event is prevented
from executing the action recursively. The occasionally has the unintended
effect of missing the last action when one releases the mouse button.
Menu items:
start end numbersteps:
Beginning and final values of the loop variable. The number of steps
includes these limiting values so should be at least 2 but if it is 1 then
the loop reduces to only the start value.
Variable:
Pops up a SymChooser for selection of a variable name.
The Family object cannot work without a variable since there is no default.
Action:
Pops up a stringchooser for selection of the body of the loop. The default
run() action is typically what is desired.
Run:
Starts the loop
Stop – Now:
Stops the loop even in the middle of the action. (The
stdrun.hoc
run()
action regularly checks the
stop_run
variable.)
Stop – Atendofaction:
Waits for the current action to finish before stopping.
Cont:
Starts the action with the next value of the variable.
(If the previous action was stopped in the middle,
that action is not restarted where it left off.)
Note
This is function is defined as part of
stdrun.hoc
which in Python is loaded automatically as part of
from
neuron
import
gui
, which is required to ensure the GUI is interactive across different
ways of running NEURON.
Note
This dialog may also be opened from the GUI via
Tools ‣ Miscellaneous ‣ Family ‣ Family
ExecCommand

Usage:
n.ExecCommand()
(Python or MATLAB) or
ExecCommand()
(HOC)
or
Tools ‣ Miscellaneous ‣ Family ‣ Command
Specify a command and execute it.

GatherVec

Open with
Vector ‣ Gather Values
or to open programmatically import GUI support, load the library, and then call the function:
Python
from
neuron
import
n
,
gui
n
.
load_file
(
'gatherv.hoc'
)
n
.
makeGatherVec
()
HOC
load_file("gatherv.hoc")
makeGatherVec()
Press “Record” button and plot a new point consisting
of the values for specified
x
and
y
variables. (
x
or
y
crosshair values
are good candidates for the
y
variable and a run parameter is a good
candidate for the
x
variable. Then one does a run, selects a point with
crosshairs, and presses the record button on the GatherValues tool)
VectorPlay

Open with
Vector ‣ Play
or to open programmatically import GUI support, load the library, and then call the function:
python
from
neuron
import
n
,
gui
n
.
load_file
(
'vplay.hoc'
)
n
.
makeVectorPlay
()
HOC
load_file("vplay.hoc")
makeVectorPlay()
Copy a vector from the clipboard and play it into some
chosen (from a Symchooser) variable name. There is button to connect
and disconnect (return the default value to the variable) the vector.
VecWrap

Open with
Vector ‣ Display
or to open programmatically import GUI support, load the library, and then call the function:
Python
from
neuron
import
n
,
gui
n
.
load_file
(
'vecwrap.hoc'
)
n
.
makeVecWrap
()
HOC
load_file
(
"vecwrap.hoc"
)
makeVecWrap
()
Copy vector(s) from the clipboard and do various
manipulations: Discard left of crosshair, discard right of crosshair,
crosshair point becomes origin. Obviously rudimentary but this egg
may hatch into something.
