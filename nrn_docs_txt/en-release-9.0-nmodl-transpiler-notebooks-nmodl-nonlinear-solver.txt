NMODL NONLINEAR solver

NONLINEAR
blocks contain a set of non-linear simultaneous equations. They can be directly specified by the user in the MOD file, or more commonly can be constructed from
KINETIC
or
DERIVATIVE
blocks by the
KineticBlock
and
SympySolver
visitors.
These equations are rewritten in the form
\[F(X) = 0,\]
where
\(X\)
is a vector containing the state variables involved in the equations, and this equation is then solved at runtime using
Newton’s method
This is an iterative method: given an approximate solution
\(X^{(n)}\)
, a better approximation is given by
\[X^{(n+1)} = X^{(n)} - J(X^{(n)})^{-1} F(X^{(n)})\]
where
\(J(X) = \frac{\partial F(X)_i}{\partial X_j}\)
is the Jacobian of
\(F\)
.
Newton solver

\(F\)
and
\(J\)
are constructed by the
solve_non_lin_system
python routine which uses SymPy to analytically differentiate
\(F\)
to find the exact Jacobian at compile time. The initial approximate solution
\(X_0\)
is chosen to simply be the current values of the state variables: as long as
\(dt\)
is not too large the solution at
\(t+dt\)
should not lie too far away.
The iterative Newton solver is called
newton_solver
and is implemented in
src/solver/newton
using the Eigen header-only matrix algebra library. Unit tests are available in
test/newton/newton.cpp
with the tags “
[analytic][solver]
”.
Fall-back solver

A fall-back solution if the analytic Jacobian is not available (for example if the equations use some custom neuron function calls that SymPy doesn’t know how to differentiate, or if
VERBATIM
blocks are used within the
NONLINEAR
block) is to use the
newton_numerical_diff_solver
variant of this solver that uses a finite difference approximation to estimate the Jacobian numerically.
This solver is also implemented in
src/solver/newton
, with Unit tests in
test/newton/newton.cpp
with the tags “
[numerical][solver]
”.
NB: this solver is implemented, but the visitor to set up the solve is not yet implemented
