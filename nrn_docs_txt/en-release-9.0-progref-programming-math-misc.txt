float_epsilon

Python
Syntax:
n
.
float_epsilon
=
1e-11
Description:
The default value is 1e-11
Allows somewhat safer NEURON logical comparisons and integer truncation for
floating point numbers. Most NEURON comparisons are treated as true if they are
within float_epsilon of being true. e.g.,
from
neuron
import
n
n
(
"""
proc count_to_1() {for (i = 0; i < 1; i += 0.1) $o1.__call__(i)}
"""
)
def
print_i
(
i
):
print
(
f
'
{
i
:
3g
}
{
int
(
10
*
i
)
}
'
)
rv
=
n
.
count_to_1
(
print_i
)
n
.
float_epsilon
=
0
# two bugs due to roundoff
rv
=
n
.
count_to_1
(
print_i
)
Warning
This has no effect on Python comparisons, which is why the example uses a
HOC procedure.
Warning
We certainly haven’t gotten every floating comparison in the program to use
float_epsilon
but NEURON has most of them including all HOC interpreter logical
operations, int, array indices, and Vector logic methods.
HOC

=
1e-11
Description:

Allows somewhat safer logical comparisons and integer truncation for
floating point numbers. Most comparisons are treated as true if they are
within float_epsilon of being true. e.g.,
for
(
i
=
0
;
i
<
1
;
i
+=
.1
)
{
print
i
,
int
(
10

// two bugs due to roundoff
