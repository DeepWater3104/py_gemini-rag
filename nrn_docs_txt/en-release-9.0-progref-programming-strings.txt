Python
Syntax:
n.sprint(strdef,
"format",
args)
Description:
Prints to a NEURON (i.e. not Python) string. See
printf()
for the description of the format.
Example:
from
neuron
import
n
strdef
=
n
.
ref
(
''
)
n
.
sprint
(
strdef
,
'There are
%d
%s
.'
,
3
,
'dendrites'
)
print
(
strdef
[
0
])
Note
Similar functionality is available for Python strings using the
%
operator or (for Python 2.6+) a
string object’s
format
method or (for Python 3.6+) with f-strings.
As Python strings are immutable, these approaches each create a new string.
We can also use f-strings to update NEURON strings by writing to
strdef[0]
; for example:
from
neuron
import
n
strdef
=
n
.
ref
(
''
)
num_parts
=
3
part
=
"dendrites"
strdef
[
0
]
=
f
'There are
{
num_parts
}
{
part
}
.'
print
(
strdef
[
0
])

Python
Syntax:
x
=
n.strcmp("string1",
"string2")
Description:
Returns negative, 0, or positive value
depending on how the strings compare lexicographically.
0 means they are identical. A positive value indicates
string1
comes after
string2
. This is a thin wrapper around
the C standard library function
strcmp
and returns the
same values it would return.
Note:
string1
and
string2
must contain
only
ASCII characters.
All strings (whether or not they contain unicode) may be compared
directly in Python via
<
,
>
,
==
, etc.
For example
"apical"
<
"basal"
would return
True
.
Note that accented characters are not treated as equal to their
non-accented counterparts. For example,
"soma"
==
"sóma"
would
return
False
.
If you wish for accented and non-accented characters to be compared
equal, one solution would be to use the third-party
unidecode
module,
available via
pip
install
unidecode
, to remove accents before running
the comparison.
