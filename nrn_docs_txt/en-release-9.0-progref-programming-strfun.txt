Python
Syntax:
sf
=
n.StringFunctions()
Description:
The StringFunctions class contains functions which you can apply to a
strdef
.  This class
exists purely for the utility of preventing pollution of name space with string operations.
Example:
from
neuron
import
n
sf
=
n
.

StringFunctions()
Description:
The StringFunctions class contains functions which you can apply to a
strdef
.  This class
exists purely for the utility of preventing pollution of name space with string operations.
Example:
objref strobj
strobj = new StringFunctions()
StringFunctions.
len
(
)

Python
Syntax:
length
=
sf.len(str)
Description:
Return the length of a string. Works with both NEURON string references and
regular Python strings.
Example:
from
neuron
import
n
sf
=
n
.
StringFunctions
()
length
=
sf
.
len
(
"hello"
)
print
(
length
)
Note
This is approximately equivalent to
len(s)
for Python strings
and to
len(s[0])
for references to NEURON strings, but it uses
the same syntax for both types of strings.
HOC
Syntax:
length
=
strobj.len(str)
Description:
Return the length of a string.
StringFunctions.
substr
(
)

Python
Syntax:
index
=
sf.substr(s1,
s2)
Description:
Return the index into
s1
of the first occurrence of
s2
.
If
s2
isn’t a substring then the return value is -1.
The arguments can be either NEURON string references or regular Python strings.
Example:
from
neuron
import
n
s1
=
n
.
ref
(
"allowed"
)
s2
=
n
.
ref
(
"low"
)
sf
=
n
.
StringFunctions
()
index
=
sf
.
substr
(
s1
,
s2
)
Note
When working with pure Python strings (not NEURON string references), the return value is the same as
s1.find(s2)
. e.g.,
sf.substr("allowed",
"low")
is equivalent to
"allowed".find("low")
and
both return
2
.
HOC
Syntax:
index
=
strobj.substr(s1,
s2)
Description:
Return the index into
s1
of the first occurrence of
s2
.
If
s2
isn’t a substring then the return value is -1.
StringFunctions.
head
(
)

Python
Syntax:
sf.head(str,
"regexp",
result)
Description:
The result contains the head of the string
up to but not including the
regexp
. returns index of
last char.
Example:
from
neuron
import
n
s1
=
n
.
ref
(
"hello world"
)
s2
=
n
.
ref
(
""
)
sf
=
n
.
StringFunctions
()
index
=
sf
.
head
(
s1
,
"[e]"
,
s2
)
print
(
s2
[
0
])

.
HOC
Syntax:
strobj.head(str,
"regexp",
result)
Description:
The result contains the head of the string
up to but not including the
regexp
. returns index of
last char.
StringFunctions.
tail
(
)

Python
Syntax:
sf.tail(str,
"regexp",
result)
Description:
The result contains the tail of the string
from the char following
regexp
to the end of the string.
return index of first char.
Other functions can be added as needed,
e.g.,
index(s1,
c1)
,
char(s1,
i)
, etc.
without polluting the global name space. In recent versions
functions can return strings.
Example:
from
neuron
import
n
s1
=
n
.
ref
(
"hello world"
)
s2
=
n
.
ref
(
""
)
sf
=
n
.

tail
(
s1
,
"[e]"
,
s2
)
print
(
s2
[
0
])
HOC
Syntax:
strobj.tail(str,
"regexp",
result)
Description:
The result contains the tail of the string
from the char following
regexp
to the end of the string.
return index of first char.
Other functions can be added as needed,
eg.,
index(s1,
c1)
,
char(s1,
i)
, etc.
without polluting the global name space. In recent versions
functions can return strings.
StringFunctions.
right
(
)

Python
Syntax:
sf.right(str,
n)
Description:
Removes first n characters from the NEURON string
str
and puts the result
back in
str
. This cannot be used with regular Python strings
because they are immutable.
Example:
from
neuron
import
n
s
=
n
.
ref
(
"hello"
)
sf
=
n
.
StringFunctions
()
sf
.
right
(
s
,
3
)
print
(
s
[
0
])
# prints: "lo"
Note
This is approximately equivalent to
s
=
s[n:]
for Python strings
except that it modifies the NEURON string in place. That is,
sf.right(s,
3)
always changes the value of
s
, while
s
=
s[n:]
creates a new string
and assigns it to
s
, but it could be assigned to any other variable and
leave the original string unchanged.
HOC
Syntax:
strobj.right(str,
n)
Description:
Removes first n characters from
str
and puts the result in
str
.
StringFunctions.
left
(
)

Python
Syntax:
sf.left(str,
n)
Description:
Removes all but the first n characters from the NEURON string
str
and puts
the result back in
str
. This cannot be used with regular Python strings
because they are immutable.
Example:
from
neuron
import
n
s
=
n
.
ref
(
"hello"
)
sf
=
n
.
StringFunctions
()
sf
.
left
(
s
,
3
)
print
(
s
[
0
])
# prints "hel"
Note
This is approximately equivalent to
s
=
s[:n]
for Python strings
except that it modifies the NEURON string in place. That is,
sf.left(s,
3)
always changes the value of
s
, while
s
=
s[:n]
creates a new string
and assigns it to
s
, but it could be assigned to any other variable and
leave the original string unchanged.
HOC
Syntax:
.left(str,
n)
Description:
Removes all but first n characters from
str
and puts the
result in
str
StringFunctions.
is_name
(
)

Python
Syntax:
sf.is_name(item)
Description:
Returns
True
if the
item
is the name of a symbol,
False
otherwise.
This is so useful that the same thing is available with the top level
name_declared()
function (except that returns 1 or 0 instead of True
or False).
Example:
from
neuron
import
n
s1
=
n
.
ref
(
"hello world"
)
sf
=
n
.
StringFunctions
()
name
=
sf
.
is_name
(
s1
)
print
(
name
)
Here is an example with one string that works,
and another that does not:
from
neuron
import
n
sf
=
n
.
StringFunctions
()
# valid name
print
(
sf
.
is_name
(
"xvalue"
))
# invalid name
print
(
sf
.
is_name
(
"xsquiggle"
))
Note
This is approximately equivalent to
item
in
dir(h)
but the Python module
h
contains additional names that are not NEURON symbols per se.
HOC
Syntax:
.is_name(str)
Description:
Returns 1 if the
str
is the name of a symbol, 0 otherwise.
This is so useful that the same thing is available with the top level
name_declared()
function.
StringFunctions.
alias
(
)

Python
Syntax:
sf.alias(obj,
"name",
_ref_var2)
sf.alias(obj,
"name",
obj2)
sf.alias(obj,
"name")
sf.alias(obj)
Description:
“name” becomes a public variable for obj and points to the
scalar pointed at by
_ref_var2
or object obj2. obj.name may be used anywhere the var2 or obj2 may
be used. With no third arg, the “name” is removed from the objects
alias list. With no second arg, the objects alias list is cleared.
Example:
from
neuron
import
n
sf
=
n
.
StringFunctions
()
v
=
n
.
Vector
()
sf
.
alias
(
v

}
'
)
n
.
t
=
42
print
(
f
'v.t =
{
v
.
t
}
'
)
HOC
Syntax:
.alias(obj,
"name",
&var2)
.alias(obj,
"name",
obj2)
.alias(obj,
"name")
.alias(obj)
Description:
“name” becomes a public variable for obj and points to the
scalar var2 or object obj2. obj.name may be used anywhere the var2 or obj2 may
be used. With no third arg, the “name” is removed from the objects
alias list. With no second arg, the objects alias list is cleared.
StringFunctions.
alias_list
(
)

Python
Syntax:
listobj
=
sf.alias_list(obj)
Description:
Return a new List object containing String objects which contain
the alias names.
Warning
The String class is not a built-in class. It generally gets declared when
gui
is imported or
stdrun.hoc
is loaded.
Note that the String class must exist and its
constructor must allow a single strdef argument. Minimally:
Example:
from
neuron
import
n
n
.
load_file
(
'stdrun.hoc'
)
sf
=
n
.
StringFunctions
()
v
=
n
.
Vector
()
al
=
sf
.
alias_list
(
v
)
print
(
al
)
HOC
Syntax:
list
=
sf.alias_list(obj)
Description:
Return a new List object containing String objects which contain
the alias names.
Warning
The String class is not a built-in class. It generally gets declared when
the nrngui.hoc file is loaded and lives in stdlib.hoc.
Note that the String class must exist and its
constructor must allow a single strdef argument. Minimally:
begintemplate String
public s
strdef s
proc init() { s = $s1 }
endtemplate String
StringFunctions.
references
(
)

Python
Syntax:
sf.references(object)
Description:
Prints the number of references to the object and all objref names
that reference that object (including references via
HBox
,
VBox
, and
List
). It also prints the number of references found.
Example:
from
neuron
import

StringFunctions.
is_point_process
(
)

Python
Syntax:
i
=
sf.is_point_process(object)
Description:
Returns 0 if the object is not a POINT_PROCESS. Otherwise
returns the point type (which is always 1 greater than the index into the
MechanismType(1)
list). In particular, the return
value is an integer, not a boolean, because it indicates position in a list.

StringFunctions.
is_artificial
(
)

Python
Syntax:
i
=
sf.is_artificial(object)
Description:
Returns 0 if the object is not an ARTIFICIAL_CELL. Otherwise
returns the point type (which is always 1 greater than the index into the
MechanismType(1)
list). In particular, the return
value is an integer, not a boolean, because it indicates position in a list.
