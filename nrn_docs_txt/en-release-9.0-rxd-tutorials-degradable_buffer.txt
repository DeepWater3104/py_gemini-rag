Example: Degradable buffer

Calcium is heavily buffered in cells, as it is a major second messenger molecule.
Calbindin D28K dynamics

The calcium buffering protein Calbindin D28K has 6 EF-hands, four of which are active calcium ion binding sites. These sites are not equally active. A calcium ion is not free to bind to any of the sites equally. Instead, calcium ions are bound in sequence: 1, 4, 5, 3 with the last binding having the lowest affinity. (Venters et al., 2003.)
(To be clear, these dynamics are not representative of all calcium buffers; Parvalbumin and Calbindin D9K show little conformational change when carrying calcium.)
\[\mathrm{Ca} + \mathrm{Calbindin_0} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Calbindin_1}\]
\[\mathrm{Ca} + \mathrm{Calbindin_1} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Calbindin_{14}}\]
\[\mathrm{Ca} + \mathrm{Calbindin_{14}} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Calbindin_{145}}\]
\[\mathrm{Ca} + \mathrm{Calbindin_{145}} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Calbindin_{1453}}\]
A model

For our model, let us suppose that instead of calbindin D28K specifically, which has its own very specific binding affinities, we have some arbitrary buffer buf that also has 4 binding sites that load sequentially.
