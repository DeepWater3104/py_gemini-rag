Computational implementation of the conceptual model

We
could
implement this model in Python:
from
neuron
import
n
,
gui
axon
=

.

axon
.
nseg

)
But
for this exercise, let’s instead use the CellBuilder tool to create the model:
Save the model in
hhaxon.ses
using
NEURONMainMenu ‣ File ‣ savesession
Using the computational model

If starting from a fresh launch of python, you can load the saved ses file by loading NEURON and its GUI:
from
neuron
import
n.
gui
and then selecting
NEURONMainMenu ‣ File ‣ loadsession
Alternatively you can use NEURON to execute
hhaxon.ses
Change to the appropriate directory in your terminal
Start python, and at the >>> prompt enter the commands
from
neuron
import
n
,
gui
n
.
load_file
(
'hhaxon.ses'
)
Exercises

Stimulate with current pulse and see a propagated action potential.
The basic tools you’ll need from the
NEURON Main Menu
Tools ‣ Point Processes ‣ Manager ‣
Point Manager
to specify stimulation
Graph ‣
Voltage axis
and
Graph ‣
Shape plot
to create graphs of v vs t and v vs x.
Tools ‣
RunControl
to run the simulation
Tools ‣ Movie Run
to see a smooth evolution of the space plot in time
Change excitability by adjusting sodium channel density.
Tool needed:
Tools ‣ Distributed Mechanisms ‣ Viewers ‣
Shape Name
Use two current electrodes to stimulate both ends at the same time
Up to this point, the model has used a very fine spatial grid calculated from the Cell Builder’s d_lambda rule
Change nseg to 15 and see what happens
