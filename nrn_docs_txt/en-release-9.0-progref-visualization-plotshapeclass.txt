Python
Class for making a Shape window useful for coloring a shape
according to a variable value and creating time and space graphs
of a variable. The default variable is
v
. The first arg may be
a SectionList.  This automatically calls
define_shape()
.


Python
Syntax:
ps.plot(graphics_object)
Description:
In NEURON 7.7+, PlotShape.plot works both with and without Interviews support.
Variables, sectionlists, and scale are supported.
Clicking on a segment displays the value and the segment id.
Extra arguments and keyword arguments are passed to the underlying graphics library
(currently only matplotlib
Figure
objects,
pyplot
, and
plotly
are
supported, with plotly support added in 7.8).
Note
If Interviews is enabled, the flag
False
must be passed to the
n.PlotShape
constructor to avoid additionally displaying a PlotShape using Interviews graphics.
See the example:
Example:
If no seclist argument is provided, PlotShape.plot will plot all sections
from
neuron
import
n
from
matplotlib
import
pyplot
n
.

(
'c91662.ses'

Note
In Jupyter, you can use
%matplotlib
notebook
to get interactive PlotShape
or use plotly instead.
Example:
You can also pass in a SectionList argument to only plot specific sections

Example:
Line width across the neuron morphology is able to be altered depending on different modes.
ps.show(0)
allows for visualizing diameters for each segment across the cell. Additionally, when
mode
=
1
or
mode
=
2
, line_width argument can be passed in to specify fixed width across cell.

for shape plots with space for size colors. All colors are initialized to
gray.
The four argument syntax, specifies the color of the index element of the
colormap. the red, green, and blue must be integers within the range 0-255
and specify the intensity of these colors.
If an existing colormap is displayed in the view, it will be redrawn with
