connect
(


Syntax:
child.connect(parent,
[0
or

child.connect(parent(x),
[0
or
1])
Description:
The first form connects the child at end 0 or 1 to the parent
section at position x. By default the child end 0 connects to the parent end 1.
An alternative syntax is the second
form in which the location on the parent section is indicated.  If a section
is connected twice a Notice is printed on the standard error device
saying that the section has been reconnected (the last connection takes
precedence).  To avoid the notice, disconnect the section first with the
function
disconnect()
.  If sections are inadvertently connected in a
loop, an error will be generated when the internal data structures are
created and the user will be required to disconnect one of the sections
forming the loop.

Description:
This is an nrniv command which creates a list of section names.  Existing sections with
the same names are destroyed and recreated.  The create statement may
occur within procedures, but the names must have been previously declared with
a create statement at the command level.
Example:
create soma, axon, dend[3]
forall {

}
prints the names of all the sections which have been created.

Syntax:

Description:
The first form connects the section at end 0 or 1 to the currently
accessed section at position x.  An alternative syntax is the second
form in which the parent section is explicitly indicated.  If a section
is connected twice a Notice is printed on the standard error device
saying that the section has been reconnected (the last connection takes
precedence).  To avoid the notice, disconnect the section first with the
function
disconnect()
.  If sections are inadvertently connected in a
loop, an error will be generated when the internal data structures are
created and the user will be required to disconnect one of the sections
forming the loop.

delete_section

Syntax:

Description:
Delete the currently accessed section from the main section
list which is used in computation.
forall
delete_section
will remove all sections.
Note: deleted sections still exist (even though
SectionRef.exists()
returns 0 and an error will result if one attempts to access
the section) so
that other objects (such as
SectionList
s and
Shape
s) which
hold pointers to these sections will still work. When the last
pointer to a section is destroyed, the section memory will be
freed.
Section.
nseg

Python
Syntax:
section.nseg
Description:
Number of segments (compartments) in
section
.
When a section is created, nseg is 1.
In versions prior to 3.2, changing nseg throws away all
“inserted” mechanisms including diam
(if 3-d points do not exist). PointProcess, connectivity, L, and 3-d
point information remain unchanged.
Starting in version 3.2, a change to nseg re-uses information contained
in the old segments.
If nseg is increased, all old segments are
relocated to their nearest new locations (no instance variables are modified
and no pointers to data in those segments become invalid).
and new segments are allocated and given mechanisms and values that are
identical to the old segment in which the center of the new segment is
located.  This means that increasing nseg by an odd factor preserves
the locations of all previous data (including all Point Processes)
and, if PARAMETER range variables are
constant, that all the new segments have the proper PARAMETER values.
(It generally doesn’t matter that ASSIGNED and STATE values do not get
interpolated since those values are computed with
fadvance()
).
If range variables are not constant then the hoc expressions used to
set them should be re-executed.
If nseg is decreased then all the new segments are in fact those old
segments that were nearest the centers of the new segments. Unused old
segments are freed (and thus any existing pointers to variables in those
freed segments are invalid). This means that decreasing nseg by an odd
factor preserves the locations of all previous data.
POINT PROCESSes are preserved regardless of how nseg is changed.
However, any POINT PROCESS that was attached to a location other
than 0 or 1 will be moved to the center of the “new segment” that
is nearest to the “old segment” to which it was attached.  The same
rule applies to child sections that had been attached to locations
other than 0 or 1.
The intention is to guarantee that the following sequence
run
()
# sim1
for
sec
in
n
.
allsec
():
sec
.
nseg
*=
oddfactor
run
()
# sim2

allsec

# sim3
will produce identical simulations for sim1 and sim3. And sim2 will be
oddfactor^2 more accurate with regard to spatial discretization error.

Description:
Number of segments (compartments) in the currently accessed section.
When a section is created, nseg is 1.
In versions prior to 3.2, changing nseg throws away all
“inserted” mechanisms including diam
(if 3-d points do not exist). PointProcesss, connectivity, L, and 3-d

are freed (and thus any existing pointers to variables in those freed

not located at the centers of the new segments will be discarded.
The intention is to guarantee that the following sequence
run() //sim1
forall nseg *= oddfactor

The index is optional and if nonzero, can be incorporated into the name as
a literal value such as dend[25]. If the optional object arg is present, that
is the context, otherwise the context is the top level. “name” should
not contain the object prefix. Even if a section is multiply dimensioned, use
a single index value.

Description:
Return the object that created the currently accessed section. If the
section was created from the top level, The NULLobject is returned.
If the section was created as a Python section and the first constructor
arg is a Python object or the keyword argument, cell = …, is used, a
PythonObject wrapper is returned. I.e. in the Python world, it is the Python
cell object.
disconnect

issection


Python
Syntax:
n.issection("regular

sec=section)
Description:
Return 1.0 if the name of
section
matches the regular expression.
Return 0.0 otherwise.
Regular expressions are like those of grep except {n1-n2} denotes
an integer range and [] is literal instead of denoting a character
range. For character ranges use <>. For example <a-z> or <abz45> denotes
any character from a to z or to any of the characters abz45.
Thus a[{8-15}] matches sections a[8] through a[15].
A match always begins from the beginning of a section name. If you
don’t want to require a match at the beginning use the dot.
(Note,
that
.
matches any character and
*
matches 0 or more occurrences
of the previous character). The interpreter always closes each string with
an implicit
$
to require a match at the end of the string. If you
don’t require a match at the end use “
.*

will print the names of all the sections which contain both Hodgkin-Huxley and Calcium ions.
sectionname
(
)

Python
Syntax:
n.sectionname(strvar,
sec=section)
Description:
The name of
section
is placed in
strvar
, a HOC string reference.
Such a string reference may be created by:
strvar
=
n.ref('')
; it’s value is
strvar[0]
.
This function is superseded by the easier to use,
str(section)
.
HOC
Syntax:
sectionname(strvar)
Description:
The name of the currently accessed section is placed in
strvar
.
This function is superseded by the easier to use,
secname()
.
secname
(
)

Python
Syntax:
n.secname(sec=section)
Description:
This function is superseded by the easier to use,
str(section)
. The below examples
can be more cleanly written as:
s
=
str(soma)
,
print(soma)
, and
for
sec
in
n.allsec():
for
seg
in
sec:
print(seg)
.
Returns the name of
section
. Usage is
s
=
n
.
secname
(
sec
=
soma
)
or
print
(
n
.
secname
(
sec
=
soma
))
or
for
sec
in
n
.
allsec
():
for
seg
in
sec
:
print
(
f
'
{
n
.
secname
(
sec
=
sec
)
}
(
{
seg
.
x
}
)'
)
# same as print(seg)
HOC
Syntax:
secname()
Description:
Returns the currently accessed section name. Usage is
strdef s
s = secname()
or
print secname()
or
forall for(x) printf("%s(%g)\n", secname(), x)
psection
(
)

Python
Syntax:
n.psection(sec=section)
Description:
Print info about
section
in a format which is executable in HOC.
(length, parent, diameter, membrane information)
Note
Beginning in NEURON 7.6,
section.psection()
returns a Python dictionary
with all the information displayed by n.psection and more (e.g.
sec.psection() returns information about reaction-diffusion kinetics).
HOC
Syntax:
psection()
Description:
Print info about currently accessed section in a format which is executable.
(length, parent, diameter, membrane information)
parent_section
(
)

Python
Syntax:
n.parent_section(x,
sec=section)
Description:
Return the pointer to the section parent of the segment
section(x)
.
Because a 64 bit pointer cannot safely be represented as a
double this function is deprecated in favor of
SectionRef.parent()
.
See also
Section.parentseg()
HOC
Syntax:
parent_section(x)
Description:
Return the pointer to the section parent of the segment containing
x
.
Because a 64 bit pointer cannot safely be represented as a
double this function is deprecated in favor of
SectionRef.parent()
.
parent_connection
(
)

Python
Syntax:
y
=
n.parent_connection(sec=child)
Description:
Return location on parent that
child
is
connected to. (0 <= x <= 1). This is the value, y, used in
child
.
connect
(
parent
(
x
),
y
)
This information is also available via:
child.parentseg().x
See also
Section.parentseg()
HOC
Syntax:
y
=
parent_connection()
Description:
Return location on parent that currently accessed section is
connected to. (0 <= x <= 1). This is the value, y, used in
connect child(x), parent(y)
section_orientation
(
)

Python
Syntax:
y
=
n.section_orientation(sec=child)
Description:
Return the end (0 or 1) which connects to the parent. This is the
value, y, used in
child
.
connect
(
parent
(
x
),
y
)
Note
It is cleaner to use the equivalent section method:
Section.orientation()
.
HOC
Syntax:
y
=
section_orientation()
Description:
Return the end (0 or 1) which connects to the parent. This is the
value, x, used in
connect child(x), parent(y)
