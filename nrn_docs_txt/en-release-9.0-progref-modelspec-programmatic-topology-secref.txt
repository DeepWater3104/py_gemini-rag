SectionRef

Note
Much of this functionality is available in Python through
Section
methods in
recent versions of NEURON. It is, however, sometimes necessary to use this class to
interoperate with legacy code.
class
SectionRef

Python
Syntax:
sref
=
n.SectionRef(sec=section)
Description:
SectionRef keeps a pointer/reference to section. If the
sec=
argument is
omitted, the reference is to the currently accessed section.
This class overcomes a HOC limitation where sections were not treated as objects.
HOC
Syntax:
section
sref
=
new
SectionRef()
Description:
SectionRef keeps a pointer/reference to a section
The reference is to the currently accessed section at the
time the object was created.
This class allows sections to be referenced as normal object variables
for assignment and passing as arguments.
SectionRef.
sec

Python
Syntax:
sref.sec
Description:
Returns the
Section
the
SectionRef
references.
from
neuron
import
n
s
=
n
.
Section
(
"s"
)
s2
=
n
.
Section
(
"s2"
)
sref
=
n
.
SectionRef
(
sec
=
s2
)
print
(
sref
.
sec
==
s
)
# False
print
(
sref
.
sec
==
s2
)
# True
HOC
Syntax:
sref.sec
Description:
special syntax that makes the reference the currently
accessed section.
This class allows sections to be referenced as normal object variables
for assignment and passing as arguments. The usage is
create soma, axon
axon.diam=2
soma.diam=10
access axon
objref s1, s2
soma s1 = new SectionRef()  // s1 holds a reference to the soma
print s1.sec.diam           // print the diameter of the soma
s2 = s1                             // s2 also holds a reference to the soma
s2.sec { psection() }               // print all info about soma
axon s2 = new SectionRef()
proc c() {
    $o1.sec connect $o2.sec(0), 1
}
c(s1, s2)
topology()
This last is a procedure that takes two SectionRef args and
connects them end to end.
SectionRef.
parent

Python
Syntax:
sref.parent
Description:
Returns the parent of
sref.sec
.
Warning
If there is a chance that a section does not have a parent then
SectionRef.has_parent()
should be called first to avoid an execution error.
Note that the parent is the current parent of sref.sec, not necessarily
the parent when the SectionRef was created.
HOC
Syntax:
sref.parent
Description:
parent of sref.sec becomes the currently accessed section. Generally it
is used in a context like
sref.parent
{
statement
}
just like a
normal section name and does NOT need a section_pop
If there is a chance that a section does not have a parent then
SectionRef.has_parent()
should be called first to avoid an execution error.
Note that the parent is the current parent of sref.sec, not necessarily
the parent when the SectionRef was created.
SectionRef.
trueparent

Python
Syntax:
sref.trueparent
Description:
Returns the trueparent of
sref.sec
.
This is normally identical to
SectionRef.parent()
except when the
parent’s
parent_connection()
is equal to the parent’s
section_orientation()
.
If there is a chance that a section does not have a trueparent then
SectionRef.has_trueparent()
should be called first to avoid an execution error.
HOC
Syntax:
sref.trueparent
Description:
trueparent of sref.sec becomes the currently accessed section.
This is normally identical to
SectionRef.parent()
except when the
parent’s
parent_connection()
is equal to the parent’s
section_orientation()
.
If there is a chance that a section does not have a trueparent then
SectionRef.has_trueparent()
should be called first to avoid an execution error.
SectionRef.
child

Python
Syntax:
sref.child[i]
Description:
Returns the ith child of
sref.sec
.
Generally it is used in a context like
for
child
in
sref
.
child
:
print
(
child
)
Note that the children are the current children of sref.sec, not necessarily
the same as when the SectionRef was created since sections may be
deleted or re-connected subsequent to the instantiation of the SectionRef.
HOC
Syntax:
sref.child[i]
Description:
the ith child of sref.sec becomes the currently accessed section.
Generally it
is used in a context like
for i=0, sref.nchild-1 sref.child[i] { statement }
Note that the children are the current children of sref.sec, not necessarily
the same as when the SectionRef was created since sections may be
deleted or re-connected subsequent to the instantiation of the SectionRef.
SectionRef.
root

Python
Syntax:
sref.root
Description:
Returns the root of
sref.sec
.
HOC
Syntax:
sref.root
Description:
root of sref.sec becomes the currently accessed section.
SectionRef.
has_parent
(
)

Python
Syntax:
boolean
=
sref.has_parent()
Description:
Returns
True
if sref.sec has a parent and
False
if sref.sec is a root section.
Invoking sref.parent when sref.sec is a root section will print an
error message and halt execution.
Note:
If
sec
is a Section, then
sec.parentseg()
is either the segment the section is
attached to or
None
if
sec
does not have a parent.
HOC
Syntax:
boolean
=
sref.has_parent
Description:
returns 1 if sref.sec has a parent and 0 if sref.sec is a root section.
Invoking sref.parent when sref.sec is a root section will print an
error message and halt execution.
SectionRef.
has_trueparent
(
)

Python
Syntax:
boolean
=
sref.has_trueparent()
Description:
returns
True
if the sref.sec parent node is not the root node and
False
otherwise.
Invoking sref.trueparent when it is the root node will print an
error message and halt execution.
HOC
Syntax:
boolean
=
sref.has_trueparent
Description:
returns 1 if the sref.sec parent node is not the root node and 0 otherwise.
Invoking sref.trueparent when it is the root node will print an
error message and halt execution.
SectionRef.
nchild
(
)

Python
Syntax:
num
=
sref.nchild()
Description:
Return the number of child sections connected to sref.sec as a float.
Note
To get the number of child sections as an int, use:
num
=
len(sref.child)
HOC
Syntax:
integer
=
sref.nchild
Description:
Return the number of child sections connected to sref.sec
SectionRef.
is_cas
(
)

Python
Syntax:
boolean
=
sref.is_cas()
Description:
Returns True if this section reference is the currently accessed (default) section, False otherwise.
Note
An equivalent expression is
(sref.sec
==
n.cas())
.
HOC
Syntax:
boolean
=
sref.is_cas()
Description:
Returns 1 if this section reference is the currently accessed section, 0 otherwise.
SectionRef.
exists
(
)

Python
Syntax:
boolean
=
sref.exists()
Description:
Returns True if the referenced section has not been deleted, False otherwise.

delete_section()
,
section_exists()
HOC
Syntax:
boolean
=
sref.exists()
Description:
Returns 1 if the section has not been deleted, 0 otherwise.
