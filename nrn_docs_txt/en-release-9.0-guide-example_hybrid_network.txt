Example of a Hybrid Network

Conceptual Model

This is the classical recurrent inhibition micronet. Principal neuron
M
(for “motoneuron”) receives excitatory input onto its dendrites from some source.
M
in turn excites inhibitory interneuron
R
(for “Renshaw cell”), which projects back onto the soma of
M
.
Computational Model

To implement the computational model we must :
define the types of cells. We’ll use a pair of biophysical models for
M
and
R
, and a NetStim artificial neuron will provide the excitatory drive to
M
.
create each cell in the network
connect the cells (this includes specifying parameters such as delays and weights)
Then we will run a simulation and plot the input and output spike trains.
