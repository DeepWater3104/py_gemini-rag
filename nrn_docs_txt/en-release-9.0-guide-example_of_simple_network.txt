Example of a Simple Network

Conceptual Model

Artificial Integrate and Fire cell with a synapse that is driven by an afferent burst of spikes.
Computational Model

To implement the computational model we must:
define the types of cells (and stimulators)
create each cell in the network
connect the cells (this includes specifying parameters such as delays and weights)
Then we will run a simulation and plot the input and output spike trains.
