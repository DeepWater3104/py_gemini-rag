NetPyNE 2021 Online Course

This courses introduces using NEURON via
NetPyNE
,
a tool designed to simplify the construction, simulation, and analysis of
network models.
The first half of the course is mostly about NEURON, neuron theory, and relevant tools. NetPyNE-specific content begins in the second half of the course.
For those who prefer, this video series may also be accessed as a
YouTube playlist
. The playlist also includes guest speakers describing their research projects using NetPyNE and student project presentations.
