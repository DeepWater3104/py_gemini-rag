
Python
Syntax:
n.ivoc_style("name",
"attribute")
Description:
Gives the style attribute to name. Any property listed in the file
$(NEURONHOME)/lib/nrn.defaults
or
$(NEURONHOME)/src/ivoc/ivocmain.c
can be changed although it may be that a few of them have already been
used by the time the interpreter is invoked.
Example:
# 7 decimal places in value field editors. Must be done prior to any panel.
n
.
ivoc_style
(
"*xvalue_format"
,
"
%.7g
"
)
# large fonts in unix. Takes effect on next panel.

Domain Restrictions for Fields

variable_domain
(
)

Python
Syntax:
n.variable_domain("varname",
lower_limit,
upper_limit)
Description:
Define the domain limits for NEURON variables. Important NEURON
variables such as dt, L, diam, and Ra have reasonable default domains.
Many parameters defined in model description files also have reasonable domains.
This function is most useful when a variable makes sense only as a
non-negative or positive number.
One can specify different domains only on a per name basis. Thus there
is only one domain specification for L and one for all the instances of
IClamp.amp but one can have a different specification
for IClamp.amp and VClamp.amp.
Note
The HOC version also supports a pointer-based specification, but that form does
not work from Python.
Note
varname
here would be things like
t
or
diam
not
n.t
or
n.diam
; i.e.
omit the
n.
prefix.
HOC
Syntax:
variable_domain(&variable,
lower_limit,
upper_limit)
variable_domain("varname",
lower_limit,
upper_limit)
Description:
Define the domain limits for any variable for which one can take its address.
At this time only field editors check the variable domain. If one
attempts to enter a value into a field editor which is not in the domain, the
value will be set to the upper or lower limit. Important NEURON
variables such as dt, L, diam, and Ra have reasonable default domains.
Many parameters defined in model description files also have reasonable domains.
This function is most useful when a variable makes sense only as a
non-negative or positive number.
One can specify different domains only on a per name basis. Thus there
is only one domain specification for L and one for all the instances of
IClamp.amp but one can have a different specification
for IClamp.amp and VClamp.amp .
PrintWindowManager Placement

pwman_place
(
)

Python
Syntax:
n.pwman_place(left,
top)
n.pwman_place(left,
top,
0)
Description:
moves the PrintWindowManager to the indicated location in pixel
coordinates where 0,0 is the top left corner of the screen.
It is intended that if you build an interface by placing windows
near the top and build right then the session you save will
be portable to other window managers and other systems with
different screen sizes.
If the third argument is 0, then the window is placed but hidden.
