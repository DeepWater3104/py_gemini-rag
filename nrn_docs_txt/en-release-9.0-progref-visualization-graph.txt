Syntax:
g

n.Graph()
g

n.Graph(False)
Description:
An instance of the
Graph
class manages a window on which x-y plots can
be drawn by calling various member functions.
The first form immediately maps the window to the screen. With a
False
(or 0) argument
the window is not mapped but can be sized and placed with the
view()
function.
Example:
The most basic interpreter prototype for producing a plot follows:
from
neuron
import
n

gui
# Create the graph
g
=

Description:
An instance of the Graph class  manages a window on which  x-y plots can
be drawn by calling various member functions.
The first form immediately maps the window to the screen. With a 0 argument
the window is not mapped but can be sized and placed with the
view()
function.
Example:
The most basic interpreter prototype for producing a plot follows:
objref g    //Creates an object reference "g" which can be made to
            //point to any object.
g = new Graph()             //Assigns "g" the role of pointing to a Graph instance
                    //created from the Graph class, and produces
                    //a graph window with x and y axes on the
                    //screen.
g.size(0, 10, -1, 1)        // specify coordinate system for the canvas drawing area
                    // numbers refer to xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax respectively
g.beginline()               //The next g.line command will move the drawing pen
                    // to the indicated point without drawing anything
for(x=0; x<=10; x=x+0.1){   //States that x values to be plotted
                            //will go from 0 to 10 in increments
                            //of 0.1.
    g.line(x, sin(x))       //States that the y values on the plot
                            //will be the sin of the x values.
}
g.flush()   //Actually draws the plot on the graph in the window.
The function
.line()
, however, only allows the user to plot one function
per
for
loop, whereas the function
.plot()
can produce several
plots per
for
loop and is therefore more effective in comparing plots.
You must use
.begin()
and
.addvar()
or
.addexpr()
in
conjunction with the
.plot
function.
objref g
g = new Graph()
g.size(0, 10, -1, 1)
g.addexpr("sin(x)") //stores sin(x) as a function to be plotted in g
g.addexpr("cos(x)") //stores cos(x) for use with g
g.addexpr("exp(-x)")        //stores exp(x) for use with g
x=0
g.begin()           //The next g.plot command will move the drawing pens
                    // for the three curves to indicated x position
for(x=0; x<=10; x=x+0.1){
    g.plot(x)       // The x value used for each expression in the
                    // addexpr list
}
g.flush()
The size in the above example is appropriate to show the sine waves nicely
but the view of the exponential only shows the first few points before it
goes out of view. Hold the right mouse button while the mouse in in the
graph window and select the “View = plot” menu item to see the entire exponential.
Selecting the “Whole Scene” menu item will return to the size specified
in the size command.

Description:
The single mode argument draws both x and y axes (no arg == mode 0).

view axes (axes in each view drawn dynamically)
when graph is created these axes are the default
mode = 1
fixed axes as in long form but start and stop chosen
according to first view size.
mode = 2
view box (box axes drawn dynamically)
mode = 3
erase axes
Arguments which specify the numbers on the axis are rounded,
and the number of tic marks is chosen so that axis labels are short numbers
(eg. not 3.3333333… or the like).
The
xpos
argument gives the location of the yaxis on the xaxis (default 0).
Without the
ntic
argument (or
ntic
=-1),
the number of tics will be chosen for you.
nminor
is the number
of minor tic marks.
shownumbers
=0 will not draw the axis labels.
invert
=1 will invert the axes.
Note:
It is easiest to control the size of the axes and the scale of
the graph through the graphical user interface.  Normally, when a
new graph is declared (eg.
g
=
new
Graph()
), the y axis
ranges from 20-180 and the x axis ranges from 50-250.
With the mouse arrow on the graph window, click on the right button
and set the arrow on
View
at the top of the button window
column.  A second button
window will appear to the right of the first, and from this button window
you can select several options.  Two of the most common are:
view=plot
Size the window to best-fit the plot which it contains.
Zoom in/out
Allows you to click on the left mouse button and perform the following
tasks:
move arrow to the right
scale down the x axis (eg. 50 - 250 becomes 100 - 110)
“shift” + move arrow to the right
view parts of the axis which are to the left of the original window
move arrow to the left
scale up the x axis (eg. 50 - 250 becomes -100 - 500)
“shift” + move arrow to the left
view parts of the axis which are to the right of the original window
move arrow up
scale down the y axis (eg. 20 - 180 becomes 57.5 - 62)
“shift” + move arrow up
view parts of the axis which are below the original window
move arrow down
scale up the y axis (eg. 20 - 180 becomes -10,000 - 5,000)
“shift” + move arrow down
view parts of the axis which are above the original window
You can also use the size command to determine the size of what you view in the
graph window.  Eg.
g.size(-1,1,-1,1)
makes both axes go from -1 to 1.

addvar
(
)

Python
Syntax:
g.addvar("label",
_ref_variable)
g.addvar("label",
_ref_variable,
color_index,
brush_index)
Description:
Add the variable to the list of items graphed when
g.plot(x)
is called.
The address of the variable is used so this is fast. The current
color and brush is used if the optional arguments are not present.
Additional syntaxes are available for plotting HOC variables.
Note
To automatically plot a variable added to a graph
g
with
addvar
against
t
during a
run()
,
stdrun.hoc
must be loaded (this is done automatically
with a
from
neuron
import
gui
) and the graph must be
added to a graphList, such as by executing
n.graphList[0].append(g)
.
Example:
g
.
addvar
(
'Calcium'
,
soma
(
0.5
)
.
_ref_cai
)
HOC
Syntax:
g.addvar("variable")
g.addvar("variable",
color_index,
brush_index)
g.addvar("label",
"variable")
g.addvar("label",
"variable",
color_index,
brush_index)
g.addvar("label",
&variable,
...)
Description:
Add the variable to the list of items graphed when
g.plot(x)
is called.
The address of the variable is computed so this is fast. The current
color and brush is used if the optional arguments are not present. The name
of the variable is
also added to the graph as a label associated with the line. If the
first two args are strings, then the first “label” arg is associated
with the line on the
graph whereas the second arg defines the variable.
The second arg may be an explicit pointer arg which allows g.addvar to be
used in Python using section(x)._ref_rangevar .
Note
To automatically plot a variable added to a graph
g
with addvar against
t
during a

,
stdrun.hoc
must be loaded and the graph must be
added to a graphList, such as by executing

expression")
g.addexpr("HOC

color_index,
brush_index)
g.addexpr("label",
"HOC
expr",
object,
....)
Description:
Add a HOC expression (eg. sin(x), cos(x), exp(x)) to the list of items graphed when
g.plot(x)
is called.
The current
color and brush is used if the optional arguments are not present. A label
is also added to the graph that indicates the name of the variable.
The expression is interpreted every time
g.plot(x)
is
called so it is more general than
addvar()
, but slower.
If the optional label is present that string will appear as the label instead
of the expr string. If the optional object is present the expr will be
evaluated in the context of that object.

plotting of lines with thousands of points.
Warning
Because Microsoft Windows is a second-class operating system, too many points, too close
together will not appear at all on a graph window.  You can, in such a case, zoom in to view
selected parts of the function.

fastflush
(
)

Python
Syntax:
.fastflush()
Description:
Flushes only the
g.plot(x)
points since the last
Graph.flush()
(or
fastflush
).
This is useful for seeing the progress of
addvar()
plots during long
computations in which the graphlines contain many thousands of points.
Make sure you do a normal
.flush
when the lines are complete since
fastflush does not notify the system of the true size of the lines.
In such cases, zooming, translation, and crosshairs do not always
work properly till after the
flush()
command has been given.
(Note, this is most useful for time plots).

Rudimentary graphing of a y-vector vs. a fixed x-vector. The y-vector
is reread on each
.flush()

and cannot keep lines.
Notes:
These vectors are assumed to be doubles and not vectors from
the Vector class.  The Vector class has its own functions
Vector.plot()
,
Vector.line()
,
Vector.mark()
for graphing vectors constructed in that class.
A segmentation violation will result if
n is greater than the vector size.
.vector("namey")
equivalent to
.vector(n,

&namey[0])
above with the advantage
that it is saved in a session (because the symbol name is known).
It is simpler in that the size n is obtained from the symbol but
the plot is vs. the index of the vector. Not implemented.

Python
Syntax:

‘s xvec and yvec. Those vectors are
resized to the number of points in the line. Also, if the line has a
label, it is copied to the vector as well (see
Vector.label()
).
The index of the line is returned. To re-get the line at a later time
(assuming no line has been inserted into the graphlist earlier than
its index value — new lines are generally appended to the list but
if an earlier line has been removed, the indices of all later lines will
be reduced) then use index-1 as the argument. Note that an argument of
-1 will always return the first line in the Graph. If the argument is
the index of the last line then -1 is returned and xvec and yvec are
unchanged. Note that thisindex is not necessarily equal to previndex+1.

g.line(x,
y)
Description:
Draw a line from the previous point to this point. This command is normally
used inside of a
for
loop.  It is analogous to
Graph.plot()
and the commands which
go along with it but avoids the need to use HOC expressions, since it plots one line at
a time.
This method takes arguments for both x and y values, so it can serve the same purpose of
the
Graph.plot()
method in conjunction with an
Graph.addexpr()
command and an
.xexpr()
command.

Syntax:
.line(x,
y)
Description:
Draw a line from the previous point to this point. This command is normally
used inside of a
for
loop.  It is analogous to
.plot()
and the commands which
go along with it.  In the case of
.line()
however, all arguments are given in
the line command itself.  Therefore, the line command only plots one line at a time, whereas
the
.plot*()
command can plot several lines using the same for loop on the same graph.
This command takes arguments for both x and y values, so it can serve the same purpose of
the
.plot
command in conjunction with an
.addexpr()
command and an
.xexpr()
command.
Example:
objref g
g = new Graph()
g.beginline()
for(t=0; t<=2*PI+0.1; t=t+0.1){
    g.line(sin(t), cos(t))
}
g.flush()
graphs a circle of radius=1, just as would the following code using
g.plot()
:
objref g
g = new Graph()
t = 0
g.addexpr("sin(t)")
g.xexpr("cos(t)")
g.begin()
for(t=0; t<=2*PI+0.1; t=t+0.1){
    g.plot(t)
}
g.flush()
Note that the arguments to
g.line
are doubles, and not chars as they are in
g.plot()


Python
Syntax:
g.crosshair_action(py_callable)
g.crosshair_action(py_callable,
vectorflag=0)
g.crosshair_action("")
Description:
While the crosshair is visible (left mouse button pressed) one
can type any key and the procedure will be executed with
three arguments added:
py_callable(x,
y,
c)
where x and y are the coordinates of the crosshair (in model
coordinates) and c is the ascii code for the key pressed.
When the optional vectorflag argument is 1, then, just prior
to each call of the
procedure_name
due to a keypress,
two temporary
Vector
objects are created
and the line coordinate data is copied to those Vectors.
With this form the call to the procedure has two args added:
procedure_name(i,
c,
xvec,
yvec)
where
i
is the index of the crosshair into the Vector.
If you wish the
Vector
data to persist then you can assign to
another objectvar before returning from the
py_callable
.
Note that one can copy any line to a
Vector
with this method whereas
the interpreter controlled
Graph.dump("expr",
y_objectref)
is
limited to the current graphline of an
addvar
or

not work unless the graph is mapped to the screen. Selection is with respect
to the primary (first) view, eg selecting “View = plot” of a Grapher will
always refer to the view in the Grapher tool as opposed to other views of
the same graph created via the “NewView” menu item. Any items created

menu_tool
(
)

Python
Syntax:
g.menu_tool("label",
"procedure_name")
g.menu_tool("label",

Description:
Add a selectable tool menu item to the Graph popup menu or else, if an
xpanel()
is open, an
xradiobutton()
will be added to the panel having the
same action. (note: all menu_tool radiobuttons whether in the graph menu
or in a panel, are in the same telltalegroup, so selecting one deselects the
previous selection.)
If the third arg exists, the
select_action
will be executed when
the radioitem is pressed (if it is not already selected).
When selected, the item will be marked and the label will appear on
the window title bar (but not if the Graph is enclosed in a
VBox()
).
When this tool is selected, pressing the left mouse
button, dragging the mouse, and releasing the left button, will cause
procedure_name
to be called with four arguments: type, x, y, keystate.
x and y are the scene (model) coordinates of the mouse pointer, and type is
2 for press, 1 for dragging, and 3 for release. Keystate reflects the
state of control (bit 1), shift (bit 2), and meta (bit 3) keys, ie control
and shift down has a value of 3.
The rate of calls for dragging is of course dependent on the time it takes
to execute the procedure name.
Example:
from
neuron
import
n
,
gui
def
on_event
(
event_type

output will appear on the terminal.
HOC

gif


Python
Syntax:
g.gif("file.gif")
g.gif("file.gif",
left,
bottom,
width,
height)
Description:
Display the gif image in model coordinates with lower left corner at 0,0
or indicated left, bottom coords. The width and height of the gif file are the
desired width and height of the image in model coordinates, by default they
are the pixel Width and Height of the gif file.
Example:
Suppose we have a gif with pixel width and height, wg and hg respectively.
Also suppose we want the gif pixel point (xg0, yg0) mapped to graph
model coordinate (x0, y0) and the gif pixel point (xg1, yg1) mapped to
graph model coordinate (x1, y1). Then the last four arguments to
g.gif should be:
left = x0 - xg0*(x1-x0)/(xg1-xg0)
bottom = y0 - yg0*(y1-y0)/(yg1-yg0)
width = wg*(x1-x0)/(xg1-xg0)
height= hg*(y1-y0)/(yg1-yg0)
If, for example with xv, you have constructed a desired rectangle on the
gif and the info (xv controls/Windows/Image Info)presented is
Resolution: 377x420
Selection: 225x279 rectangle starting at 135,44
then use
{wg=377 hg=420}
{xg0=135 yg0=420-(279+44) xg1=135+225 yg1=420-44}
Warning
In the single arg form, if the gif size is larger than the graph model
coodinates, the graph is resized to the size of the gif. This prevents
excessive use of memory and computation time when the graph size is on
the order of a gif pixel.
