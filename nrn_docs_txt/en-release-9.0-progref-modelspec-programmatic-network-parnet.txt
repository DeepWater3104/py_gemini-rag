Description:
Manages the setup and running of a network simulation on a cluster
of workstations or any parallel computer that has mpi installed.
A version for PVM is also available. This class, implemented
in
nrn/share/lib/hoc/netparmpi.hoc
, presents an interface
compatible with the NetGUI style of network specification, and is implemented
using the
Parallel Network
methods. Those methods are
available only if NEURON has been built with the configuration option,
–with-mpi. The
netparmpi.hoc
file at last count was only 430 lines long
so if you have questions about how it works that are not answered here,
take a look.
Experience with published network models where there is an order of magnitude
more segments or cells than machines, suggests that superlinear speedup
occurs up to about 20 to 50 machines due to the fact that the parallel
machine has much more effective high speed cache memory than a single
cpu. Basically, good performance will occur if there is a lot for each
machine to do and the amount of effort to simulate each machine’s subnet
is about equal. If cell granularity causes load balance to be
a signficant problem see
ParallelNetManager.splitcell()
.
The “lot for each machine to do” is relative to the
number of spikes that must be exchanged between machines and how often
these exchanges take place. The latter is determined by the minimum
delay between a spike event generated on one machine that must be delivered
to another machine since that defines the interval that each machine
is allowed to integrate before having to share all spikes it generated
which are destined for other machines.
The fundamental requirement for the use of this class is for the
programmer to be able to associate a unique global id (gid) for each
cell and define the connectivity by means of the source_cell_gid and the
target_cell_gid. If the target cell happens to have synapses, we assume
they can be found via a local synapse index into the target cell’s synapse list.
We absolutely must use global indices because it
will be the case that when a connection is requested
on a machine that either the source or the target cell or both may not
actually exist on the machine – the last case is a no-op.
The following describes the author’s intention as to how this class can
be used to construct and simulate a parallel network.
It is assumed that every machine
executes exactly the same code (though with different data).
So that the concatenation of all the following fragments will
end up being a valid network simulation for a ring of 128 artificial
cells where cell i sends a spike to cell i+1, let’s start out with
from
neuron
import
n
n
.
load_file
(
'stdrun.hoc'
)
tstop
=
1000
Yes, I know that this example is foolish since there is no computation
going on except when a cell receives a spike. I don’t expect any benefit
from parallelization but it is simple enough to allow me to focus on the process
of setup and run instead of cluttering the example with a large cell class.
load the
netparmpi.hoc
file and create a ParallelNetManager
n
.
load_file
(
"netparmpi.hoc"
)
ncell
=
128
pnm
=

.
ParallelNetManager
(
ncell
)
If you know the global number of cells put it in. For the non-MPI
implementation of ParallelNetManager, ncell is absolutely necessary
since that implementation constructs many mapping vectors that allow
it to figure out what cell is being talked about when the gid is
known. The MPI implementation uses dynamically constructed maps and
it is not necessary to know the global number of cells at this time.
Note that ncell refers to the global number of cells and NOT the
number of cells to be created on this machine.
Tell the system which gid’s are on which machines.
The simplest distribution mechanism is
round_robin()
pnm
.
round_robin
()
which will certainly give good load balance if the number of each
cell type to be constructed is an integer multiple of the number
of machines. Otherwise specify which gid’s are on which machines through
the use of
ParallelNetManager.set_gid2node()
. Note that you only
HAVE to call
pnm.set_gid2node(gid,
myid)
for the subset of gid’s that
are supposed to be associated with this machines
particular
myid
=
pnm.pc.id
but it is usually simpler just to call
it for all gid’s since the
set_gid2node
call is a no-op when the second
argument does not match the pc.id. Also, the PVM version REQUIRES that
you call the function for all the gid values.
There are three performance considerations with regard to sprinkling gid
values on machines.
By far the most important is load balance. That is
simple if all your cells take the same time to integrate over the same
interval. If cells have very different sizes or cpu’s end up with
very different amounts of work to do so that load balance is a
serious problem then
ParallelNetManager.splitcell()
can be used to
solve it.
Of lesser importance but still quite important is to maximize the
delay of NetCon’s that span machines. This isn’t an issue if all your
NetCon delays are the same.  The minimum delay across machines defines
the maximum step size that each machine can integrate before having
to share spikes. In principle, Metis can help with this and C) but don’t
waste your time unless you have established that communication overhead
is your rate limiting step. See
ParallelNetManager.prstat()
and
ParallelContext.wait_time()
.
I am only guessing that this is less important than B, it is certainly
related, but obviously
things will be better if you minimize the number of spanning NetCon’s.
For our ring example it obviously would be best to keep neighboring cells together
but the improvement may be too small to measure.
Now create only the cells that are supposed to be on this machine
using
ParallelNetManager.register_cell()
.
for
i
in
range
(
ncell
):
if
pnm
.
gid_exists
(
i
):
pnm
.
register_cell
(
i
,
n
.
IntFire1
())
Notice how we don’t construct a cell if the gid does not exist.
You only HAVE to call
register_cell for those gid’s which are actually owned by this machine and
need to send spikes to other machines.
If the gid does not exist, then register_cell will call gid_exists for you.
Note that 2) and 3) can
be combined but it is a serious bug if a gid exists on more than one machine.
You can even start connecting
as discussed in item 4) but of course a NetCon presupposes the existence
of whatever cells it needs on this machine.
Of course this presupposes that you have
already read the files that define your cell classes.
We assume your
cell classes for “real” cells follow the NetworkReadyCell policy required by
the NetGUI tool. That is, each “real” cell type has a synapse list, eg. the
first synapse is
cell.synlist.object(0)
(the programmer will have to
make use of those synapse indices when such cells are the target of a NetCon)
and each “real” cell type has a connect2target method that constructs
a netcon (returns it in the second argument)
with that cell as the source and its first argument as the
synapse or artificial cell object.
Artificial cells can either be unwrapped or follow the NetGUI tool policy
where they are wrapped in a cell class in which the actual artificial cell
is given by the
cell.pp
field and the cell class also has a
connect2target method.
If you don’t know what I’ve been talking about in the last two paragraphs,
use the NetGUI tool on a single machine to construct a toy network consisting
of a few real and artificial cells and save it to a hoc file for examination.
Connect the cells using
ParallelNetManager.nc_append()
for
i
in
range
(
ncell
):
pnm
.
nc_append
(
i
,
(
i
+
1
)
%
ncell
,
-
1
,
1.1
,
2
)
Again, it only has to be called if i, or i + 1, or both, are on this machine.
It is a no-op if neither are on this machine and usually a no-op if only
the source is on this machine since it will only mark the source cell
as output cell, once.
The -1 just refers to the
synapse index which should be -1 for artificial cells.
The delay is 2 ms and the weight is 1.1 which guarantees
that the IntFire1 cell will fire when it receives a spike.
Our example requires a stimulus and this is not an
unreasonable time to stimulate the net.
Let’s get the ring going by forcing the gid==4
cell to fire.
# stimulate

Note the stimulator does not require a gid even though it is an artificial
cell because its connections do not span machines. But it does have to be
on the machine that has the cell it is connecting to.
Have the system figure out the minimum spanning NetCon delay so it knows
the maximum step size.

ParallelNetManager.gid_exists()
and then use

the synapse_id should be -1 and the target artificial cell is
pnm.gid2obj(target_gid)
. Note that
the target is an unwrapped artificial cell if
StringFunctions.is_point_process()
returns a non-zero value.
If the target exists but not the source, the netcon
is created via
ParallelContext.gid_connect()
and added to the
pnm.nclist.
If the source exists but not the target, and
ParallelContext.gid_exists()
returns
1 (instead of 2) then the cell is marked to be an
ParallelContext.outputcell()
.
If the source exists and is a real cell or wrapped artificial
cell
pnm.gid2obj(src_id).connect2target(synapse_target_object,
nc)
is used to
create the NetCon.
If the source exists and is a artificial cell
then the NetCon is created directly.
If neither the source or target exists,
there is nothing to do.

Prints a high resolution amount of time all the machines have waited for
spike exchange. If some are much higher than others then there is likely
a load balance problem. If they are all high relative to the simulation
time then spike exchange may be the rate limiting step.
If the argument is 1, then, in addition to wait time, spike_statistics
are printed. The format is

splitcell
(
)

Python
Syntax:
pnm.splitcell(hostcas,
hostparent,
sec=split_at)
Description:
The cell is split at the section
split_at
and that section’s
parent into two subtrees rooted at the old connection end of
split_at
and the old
split_at
connecting point of the parent (latter must be
0 or 1). The
split_at
subtree will be preserved on the host specified
by hostcas and the parent subtree will be destroyed. The parent subtree
will be preserved on the host specified by hostparent and the
split_at
subtree destroyed. Hostparent must be either
host_split_at+1
or
host_split_at-1
.
Splitcell works only if NEURON has been configured with the
–with-paranrn option. A split cell has exactly the same stability
and accuracy properties as if it were on a single machine. Splitcell
cannot be used with variable step methods at this time. A cell can
be split into only two pieces.
Splitcell is implemented using the
ParallelContext.splitcell()
method
of
ParallelContext
.
