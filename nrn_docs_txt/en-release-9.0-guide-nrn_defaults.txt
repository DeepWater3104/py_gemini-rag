The appearance of NEURON’s graphical windows is controlled by definitions in the file
$(NEURONHOME)/lib/nrn.defaults
(under MSWindows it’s
c:\nrnxx\lib\nrn.def
where
xx
is the version number). This is a plain ASCII file that you can edit with a text editor.
What’s $(NEURONHOME)?
Start NEURON, and at the oc> prompt type
neuronhome
()
On my Linux box, this tells me that $(NEURONHOME) is
/usr/local/nrn/share/nrn
and sure enough,
nrn.defaults
is in
/
usr
/
local
/
nrn
/
share

How to change the background color used in shape plots and other graphs

Change the lines
*
Scene_background
:
#ffffff
*
Scene_foreground
:
#000000
to whatever you like. For example,
*
Scene_background
:
#000000
*
Scene_foreground
:
#ffffff
makes the background black and the axes and black traces white.

tell you which file contains the colormap that will be used (under MSWin it’s
c:\nrnxx\lib\shape.cm2
). The colormap file is read when NEURON is initially launched. If the file doesn’t exist, NEURON uses a default scale.
The colormap file is plain ASCII, with one set of RGB values per line. NEURON comes with a couple of different scales in files shape.cm1 and shape.cm2.
