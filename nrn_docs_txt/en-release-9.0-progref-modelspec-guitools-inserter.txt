Inserter

Insert and remove mechanisms.  Keep default parameters between removal
and re-insertion.  Most useful in context of single compartment
simulations.
Note that when a mechanism is removed by clicking on a checkmarked
mechanism, the parameters are saved in a MechanismStandard. When
the Mechanism is re-installed, those parameters are restored.
If the Inserter panel is saved in a session, the MechanismStandards are
saved as well.
