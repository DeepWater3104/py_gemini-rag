Standard Run Tools

Python
All standard tools are available from the NEURONMainMenu. The fastest
way to load these tools is to execute:
from
neuron
import
gui
HOC
All standard tools are available from the NEURONMainMenu. The fastest
way to load these tools is to execute
load_file("nrngui.hoc")
Brief summaries of the menu options are provided below, for more information on select functions see also:
RunControl
Family
ExecCommand
GatherVec
VectorPlay
VecWrap
Implementations of the standard tools are in
$NEURONHOME/lib/hoc/*.hoc
NEURON Main Menu

Python
Main menu for standard control, graphing, menu generation.
To pop up the panel execute:
from
neuron
import
gui
Warning
In HOC code, you may see
load_file('nrngui.hoc')
instead, but that does not work for Python code
as it does not start the thread that monitors for GUI events.
Serious users should peruse the init and run procedures.
The run chain that eventually calls
fadvance()
is
n.run --> n.continuerun --> n.step --> n.advance --> n.fadvance
HOC
Main menu for standard control, graphing, menu generation.
To pop up the panel execute:
load_file("nrngui.hoc")
Serious users should peruse the init and run procedures.
The run chain that eventually calls
fadvance()
is
n.run --> n.continuerun --> n.step --> n.advance --> n.fadvance
There is often reason to substitute a new step or advance
procedure to do intermediate calculations on the fly.
Sometimes it is useful to replace the init() procedure. If so
make sure you don’t take away functionality which is already
there. See
$NEURONHOME/lib/hoc/stdrun.hoc
for the
implementations of these procedures.
Note
In new code, consider using
FInitializeHandler
instead. NEURON
supports multiple
FInitializeHandler
objects at the same time,
and using them avoids the need to modify any “standard” HOC routines while
still allowing the graphical tools to do the right thing.
A simple example of overriding init:
Python
n
(
'proc init() {finitialize(v_init) nrnpython("myinit()")}'
)
def
myinit
():
# new code to happen after initialization here
print
(
'initializing...'
)
# only need the following if states have been changed
if
n
.
cvode
.
active
():
n
.
cvode
.
re_init
()
else
:
n
.
fcurrent
()
n
.
frecord_init
()
HOC
proc
init
()
{
finitialize
(
v_init
)
// new code to happen after initialization here
print
"initializing..."
// only need the following if states have been changed
if
(
cvode

active

{
cvode
.
re_init

}
else
{
fcurrent

}
frecord_init

The absolute tolerance used by CVode when it is
active is given by this value times the specific state scale factor.
This latter is normally 1, eg, for voltage,
but if the state is normally found in a range <<1 or >>1 the scale
factor may be explicitly specified in a model description or in
the interpreter.
See
CVode.atol()
and
CVode.atolscale()
PointProcesses

Several useful tools for managing PointProcesses
See
Point Processes and Artificial Cells
for details about built-in point
processes. The corresponding

examined in order to understand the particulars about a given
point process type.
Distributed Mechanisms

Several useful tools for managing density mechanisms such
as distributed channels.
See

for details about built-in density
mechanisms. The corresponding
.mod
file must in general be
examined in order to understand the particulars about a given
mechanism type.

membrane mechanisms in all sections of a simulation.

.
globalRa

Pops up a panel for assigning a
uniform value of
Ra
(ohm-cm) to all sections.
Ra used to be a global variable but is now a Section variable that
can be different in different sections. This sets Ra forall sections
equal to the value displayed in the fieldeditor. It used to
be displayed in the NEURONMainMenu but that location is now
administratively incorrect and error prone for models which manage
Ra through the
CellBuilder
.

Impedance
class to calculate
voltage attenuation as a function of position and frequency

have been placed under NEURON
project
control.

) the value of the functions
are plotted.
Currentaxis

Plots values vs t-.5dt
Suitable for plotting ionic currents (when calculations are
secondorder
correct).

This is suitable for selecting vectors from the PlotWhat menu
and seeing them change every time step.
PhasePlane

Starts a
Graph
for plotting f(t) vs g(t). When started a dialog
box pops up requesting the expression for g(t). As in the PlotWhat
browser for graphs you may enter any variable or function, but it
should change when the RunControl’s InitRun button is pressed.
Grapher

Starts a
Grapher
tool for plotting any expression vs a specified
independent variable. Lines are not drawn on this graph in
response to a run. However it can be made to control a family
of runs.
Voltageaxis

Plots values vs t.
Suitable for plotting voltage and concentrations, especially when
calculations are secondorder correct.
v(.5) of currently selected section is always plotted but can
be explicitly removed with the Delete command in the Graph menu.
Vector

Save to File

Menu for saving/retrieving the last Vector selection to a file. eg.
from a
PickVector
as well as other Vector tools.
The format of the file is:
optional first line with the format
label:anystring
optional line with one number which is the count of points.
a tab separated pair of x, y coordinates
each line. If there is no “count” line, there must be
no empty lines at the end of the file and the last character must
be a newline.
When the file is saved with this menu item,
the label and count are always present in the file.
For long files retrieval is much more efficient if the count is present.
The implementation of these operations is in
$NEURONHOME/lib/hoc/stdlib.hoc
vectors and performing simple manipulations on them.

and window groups.
Windows mapped to the screen are indicated by a checkmark; others are
hidden. Windows may be hidden by selecting the
Hide
item on the
menubar under the window title. Windows may be hidden or mapped by selecting
the item in the ungrouped window list. Selecting a window group will hide
or map all the windows in that group.
Ungrouped

A window appears in this list if it is not a member of a window group.
All ungrouped windows may be mapped or hidden by selection of the show
or hide menu item.
GroupManager

Window group names appear in this list. Selecting this item pops up
a window group manager used for creating, renaming, inserting/deleting
windows into the group, and saving a selected group to a session file.
The window group manager is a dialog box so it must be closed after use.
When a window group name is defined it may be selected in the WindowGroups
list. The windows of the group are indicated in the middle list.
Selecting items in this list and the ungrouped windows list removes or
inserts the window into the group.
