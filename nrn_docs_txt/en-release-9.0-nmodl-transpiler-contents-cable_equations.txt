Cable Equation

Note
NEURON has a sophisticated system for allowing users to describe the
geometry of neurons. Here we’ll try to derive the equations in a manner that
hides those details whenever they’re not relevant to NMODL. Please consult
its geometry related documentation or one of its publications, e.g.
The
NEURON Simulation Environment
.
In order to derive the
cable equations
we model a neuron as an electrical
circuit. We first pick points along the neuron at which we model the voltage.
We’ll call them nodes and connect the nodes to form a graph. At every branch
point we place a node, see Figure 1.


Two adjacent nodes are connected by a resistor. The interesting behaviour comes
from a difference in ion concentrations across the membrane. This difference is
upheld by three processes: a) the membrane which is largely impermeable to
ions, effectively creating a barrier for ions; b) (voltage-gated) ion channels
that conditionally allow ions to quickly cross the membrane; and c) ion pumps
which continuously pump ions across the membrane to restore a resting state.
The fact that the membrane is (mostly) impermeable to ions means that it
behaves like a dielectric material and can therefore be modeled by a capacitor.
The ion pumps and channels we simply model by a current
\(I\)
.
This model gives rise to the circuit shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2: Illustration of the circuit near one node. The total trans-membrane
current is
\(I_M\)
, the current due to the dielectric property of the
membrane is
\(I_C\)
, and all mechanism specific currents are represented
by
\(I\)

We can start writing down equations. Let’s recall the formula for a capacitor
and Ohm’s Law:
\[I = C \frac{dV}{dt}, \qquad
\Delta V = R I\]
Using Kirchoff’s Law we can write down two equations for the trans-membrane
current:
\[\begin{split}I_M &= I_C + I(V_1) \\
I_{0,1} &= I_{1, 2} + I_M\end{split}\]
which leads to
\[\begin{split}I_C + I = I_{0,1} - I_{1, 2} \\
I_C + I_{1,2} - I_{0, 1} = -I\end{split}\]
which can be rewritten in terms of the voltage as follows:
\[C \frac{dV_1}{dt} + R_{1,2}^{-1} (V_{2} - V{1}) - R_{0,1}^{-1} (V_{1} - V_{0}) = - I(V_1)\]
This can be discretized by implicit Euler:
\[C \frac{V_1^{n+1} - V_1^{n}}{\Delta t} + R_{1,2}^{-1} \left(V_{2}^{n+1} - V_{1}^{n+1}\right) - R_{0,1}^{-1} \left(V_{1}^{n+1} - V_{0}^{n+1}\right) = - I(V_1^{n+1})\]
We collect terms as follows:
\[R_{0,1}^{-1} V_{0}^{n+1}
+ \left(\frac{C}{\Delta t} + R_{0,1}^{-1} - R_{1,2}^{-1}\right) V_1^{n+1}
+ R_{1,2}^{-1} V_{2}^{n+1}
= \frac{C}{\Delta t} V_1^{n} - I(V_1^{n+1})\]
The unpleasant term is
\(I(V_1^{n+1})\)
since it makes the system non-linear.
Therefore, it’s linearized as follows:
\[\begin{split}I(V_1^{n+1})
&\approx I_1^{n} + \left(V^{n+1} - V^{n}\right) \frac{dI_1}{dV_1} \\
&=: I_1^{n} + \left(V^{n+1} - V^{n}\right) g_i^{n}\end{split}\]
where
\(g_i^{n}\)
is the mechanism dependent (differential) conductance.
