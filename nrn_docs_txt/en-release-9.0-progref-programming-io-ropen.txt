Open and Write to Files (Obsolete)

ropen
(
)

Python
Syntax:
n.ropen("infile")
n.ropen()
Description:
n.ropen("infile")
opens
infile
for reading.  A subsequent
n.ropen()
with no arguments
closes the previously opened
infile
. A file which is re-opened with
ropen(infile)
positions the stream at the beginning of the file.
Example:
###########################################
### create a file titled "file.dat" with: #
### 42 13.7                               #
### 14 64.1                               #
### 12 9                                  #

Warning
There is no way to open more than one read file at a time.  The same is
true for write files.

Syntax:

ropen()
Description:
Ropen()
opens
infile
for reading.  A subsequent
ropen()
with no arguments
closes the previously opened
infile
. A file which is re-opened with
ropen(infile)
positions the stream at the beginning of the file.
Example:
proc r() {
   ropen("file.dat")
   for (i=0; i<ndat; i=i+1) {
      x[i] = fscan()  y[i]=fscan()
   }
   ropen()
}
Diagnostics:
This function returns 0 if the file is not successfully opened.

wopen
(
)

Python
Syntax:
n.wopen("outfile")
n.wopen()
Description:
n.wopen()
is similar to
n.ropen()
but opens a file for writing. Contents of an
already existing
outfile
are destroyed.  Wopened files are written to
with
fprint()
. With no argument, the previously wopened file is closed.
n.wopen() returns 0 on failure to open a file.
Example:
from
neuron
import
n
def
w_open
(
ndat
,
x
,
y
):
n
.
wopen
(
"file.dat"
)
for

in

(

.

wopen()
Description:

outfile
are destroyed.  Wopened files are written to
with
fprint()
. With no argument, the previously wopened file is closed.
Wopen returns 0 on failure to open a file.
Example:
proc w() {
   wopen("file.dat")
   for (i=0; i<ndat; i=i+1) {
      fprint("%g %g\n", x[i], y[i])
   }

xopen
(
)

Python
Syntax:
n.xopen("hocfile")
n.xopen("hocfile",
"RCSrevision")
Description:
n.xopen()
executes the commands in
hocfile
.  This is a convenient way
to define user functions and procedures.
An optional second argument is the RCS revision number in the form of a
string. The RCS file with that revision number is checked out into a
temporary file and executed. The temporary file is then removed.  A file
of the same primary name is unaffected.

Description:
Same as

. If no file
is opened it prints to the standard output.
