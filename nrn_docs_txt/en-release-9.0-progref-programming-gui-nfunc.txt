Miscellaneous Menus

Note
In Python, GUI menus require one to have previously run:
from
neuron
import
gui
The MATLAB interface does not currently support NEURON’s InterViews-based GUI
tools.

Python
Syntax:
n.nrnglobalmechmenu("mechname")
n
=
n.nrnglobalmechmenu("mechname",
0)
Description:
pops up panel containing all global variables defined by the
mechanism.
n.nrnglobalmechmenu("
mechname
",
0)
returns the number of global variables
for this mechanism. Does not pop up a panel.

Description:

nrnglobalmechmenu("
mechname


Python
Syntax:
n.nrnpointmenu(PointProcessObject)
n.nrnpointmenu(PointProcessObject,
labelstyle)
Description:
Pops up panel containing all variables of the point process.
if the point process is relocated to another position then the
label will be incorrect and the window should be dismissed and
recreated.
If the second arg exists,  a value of -1 means to not prepend
a label. 0 means to use the Object name as the label. 1 (default)
means to use the object name along with location when the panel was
created.

nrnsecmenu


Python
Syntax:
n.nrnsecmenu(x,
vartype,
sec=section)
Description:
Pop up a panel containing variables in the
section
.
0 < x < 1 shows variables at segment containing x
changing these variables changes only the values in that segment
eg. equivalent to
section.v(.2)
=
-65
x = -1 shows range variables which are constant (same in
each segment  of the section).
changing these variables makes the variable constant in the
entire section. eg. equivalent to section.v = -65.
Variables that are not constant get a label to that effect
instead of a field editor.
vartype=1,2,3 shows parameters, assigned, or states respectively.

Syntax:
nrnsecmenu(x,

Description:
Pop up a panel containing variables in the currently accessed section.
0 < x < 1 shows variables at segment containing x
changing these variables changes only the values in that segment
eg. equivalent to
section.v(.2)
=
-65
x = -1 shows range variables which are constant (same in

entire section. eg. equivalent to section.v = -65.
