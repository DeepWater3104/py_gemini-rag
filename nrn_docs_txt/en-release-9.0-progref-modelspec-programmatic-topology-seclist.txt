Python
Syntax:
sl
=
n
.
SectionList
()
sl
=
n
.
SectionList
(
python_iterable_of_sections
)
Description:
Class for creating and managing a list of sections. Unlike a regular list, a
SectionList
allows including sections
based on neuronal morphology (e.g. subtrees).
Example Usage:
If
sl
is a
SectionList
, then to turn that into a Python list, use
py_list
=
list(sl)
; note
that iterating over a SectionList is supported, so it may not be neccessary to create a Python list.
The second syntax creates a SectionList from the Python iterable and is equivalent
to:
sl
=
n
.
SectionList
()
for
sec
in
python_iterable_of_sections
:
sl
.
append
(
sec
)
len(sl)
returns the number of sections in the SectionList.
list(sl)
and
[s
for
s
in
sl]
generate equivalent lists.
