CoreNEURON

CoreNEURON
is a compute engine for the NEURON simulator optimised for both memory usage and computational speed on modern CPU/GPU architectures.
Some of its key goals are to:
Efficiently simulate large network models
Reduce memory usage
Support execution on specialised hardware, GPUs
Support optimisations such as vectorisation and cache-efficient memory layout (e.g. Structure-Of-Arrays)
CoreNEURON is tightly integrated with NEURON, and can transparently simulate a large number of NEURON models.
Certain conditions that must be met are covered in the
CoreNEURON Compatibility
section.
