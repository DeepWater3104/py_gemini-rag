Syntax:
n.print_session(useprinter,
"name")
n.print_session(useprinter,
"name",
useselected)
n.print_session()
Description:
Print a postscript file consisting of certain windows on the screen.
If useprinter==1 postscript is piped to the filter given by “name”
which should be able to deal with standard input (UNIX). If useprinter==0
the postscript is saved in the file specified by “name”.
If there is a third arg equal to 1 then the printed windows are those
selected and arranged on the paper icon of the
Print & File Window Manager
and calling this function
is equivalent to pressing the
Print
button. Otherwise all
printable windows are printed in landscape mode with a size such that
the screen fits on the paper.
If there are no arguments then all the windows are printed in way that
works for mac, mswin, and unix.
