State and parameter discontinuities

Transient voltage clamp to assess action potential stability.

Force a discontinuous change in potential during an Action Potential.

To work properly with variable time step methods, models that change states and/or parameters discontinuously during a simulation must notify NEURON when such events take place. This exercise illustrates the kinds of problems that occur when a model is changed without reinitializing the variable step integrator.
Start with a current pulse stimulated HH patch. We recommend that you try creating this yourself with a brief current pulse at t = 0.1, either in Python or with the GUI tools. Our Python solution is
hh_patch.py
.
Discontinuously change the voltage by +20 mV via
def
change
():
print
(
f
'change at
{
n
.
t
}
'
)
soma
.
v
+=
20
def
setup_discontinuities
():
n
.
cvode
.
event
(
2
,
change
)
fih
=
n
.
FInitializeHandler
(
setup_discontinuities
)
Note the difference between the fixed and variable step methods.
Replace the
change()
function with the following and try again:
def
change
():
print
(
f
'change at
{
n
.
t
}
'
)
soma
.
v
+=
20
n
.
cvode
.
re_init
()
What happens if you discontinuously change a parameter such as
gnabar_hh
during the interval 2-3 ms without notifying the variable time step method?
def
change
(
action
):
print
(
f
'change at
{
n
.
t
}
:
{
action
}
'
)
if
action
==
'raise'
:
soma
(
0.5
)
.
hh
.
gnabar
*=
2
else
:
soma
(
0.5
)
.
hh
.
gnabar
/=
2
# n.cvode.re_init()   # should be here for cvode, but see below
def
setup_discontinuities
():
n
.
cvode
.
event
(
2
,
(
change
,
'raise'
))
n
.
cvode
.
event
(
3
,
(
change
,
'lower'
))
fih
=
n
.
FInitializeHandler
(
setup_discontinuities
)
It will be helpful to use the Crank-Nicolson fixed step method and compare the variable step method with and without the
cvode.re_init()
. Zoom in around the discontinuity at 2 ms.
