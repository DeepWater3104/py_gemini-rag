Warning
Use this class only when writing HOC code or (in Python) when interacting with legacy code.
In Python, NEURON pointers can be assigned to a variable
and manipulated directly; this class was created as a work-around for HOC which does not permit assigning
pointers to a variable.

Python
Syntax:
n.Pointer(_ref_x)
n.Pointer("variable")
n.Pointer(_ref_x,
"stmt
that
may
contain
$1")
n.Pointer("variable",
"stmt
that
may
contain
$1
or

name")
Example:
>>>
p
=
n
.
Pointer
(
n

>>>

Description:
Holds a reference to a variable. When memory for the variable is freed,
the Pointer will return an error if used.
The optional second arg is used by
Pointer.assign()
and is described
there.
Warning
The string variable arguments refer to HOC variable names not Python variable names. See
Pointer.s()
for an example.
HOC
Syntax:
Pointer(&x)
Pointer("variable")
Pointer(&x,
"stmt
that
may
contain
$1")
Pointer("variable",
"stmt
that
may
contain
$1
or
variable
name")
Description:
Holds a reference to a variable. When memory for the variable is freed,
the Pointer will return an error if used.
See
Pointer.assign()
for the meaning of the optional second arg.

val

Python
Syntax:
x
=
ptr.val
ptr.val
=
expr
Description:
Returns the value of the variable pointed to by ptr or, if the left
hand side of an assignment, sets the value of the variable. See the example in the constructor.
HOC
Syntax:

=

Description:
Returns the value of the variable pointed to by ptr or, if the left

Pointer.
s
(
)

Python
Syntax:
str
=
ptr.s()
Description:
If the Pointer was constructed with the name of a variable, that name
can be retrieved as a string.
Example:
>>>
n
(
'create soma'
)
1
>>>
p
=
n
.
Pointer
(
'soma.v(0.5)'
)
>>>
p
.
s
()
'soma.v(0.5)'
HOC
Syntax:
str
=
ptr.s
Description:
If the Pointer was constructed with the name of a variable, that name
can be retrieved as a strdef.

assign
(
)

Python
Syntax:
x
=
ptr.assign(val)
Description:
Sets the value of the pointer variable to val. If  prt was constructed
with a second arg then the execution depends on its form. If the
second arg string contains one or more $1 tokens, then the tokens
are replaced by
hoc_ac_
,
hoc_ac_
is set to the val and the resulting
statement is executed. Otherwise the second arg string is assumed to
be a variable name and a statement of the form
variablename =
hoc_ac_
is executed.
Note that the compiling of these statements takes place just once when
the Pointer is constructed. Thus
ptr.assign(val)
is marginally
faster than execute(“stmt with val”).
Returns val.

=
ptr.assign(val)
Description:
Sets the value of the pointer variable to val. If  prt was constructed

second arg string contains one or more $1 tokens, then the tokens
are replaced by
hoc_ac_
,

Note that the compiling of these statements takes place just once when
the Pointer is constructed. Thus ptr.assign(val) is marginally
faster than execute(“stmt with val”).
(following not implemented) And if the stmt is a variablename
then the pointer is used and all interpreter overhead is avoided.
Also note that on construction, the second arg variable is executed with the
value of the first arg pointer. So
Returns val.
