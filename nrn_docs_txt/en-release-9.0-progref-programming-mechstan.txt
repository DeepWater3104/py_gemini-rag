Python
Syntax:
ms

.
MechanismStandard
(
name_str
)
ms
=
n
.
MechanismStandard
(
name_str
,
vartype
)
Description:
In Python, consider the use of
sec.psection()
which encapsulates MechanismType and MechanismStandard so as to return a dictionary.
With no vartype or vartype = 1, this provides
storage for parameter values of a membrane mechanism or point process.
This class is useful in maintaining a default set of parameters and can
be used to specify values for a set of sections.
name_str
is a density mechanism such as
hh
or a point process
such as
VClamp
. A
MechanismStandard
instance, when created,
contains default values for all parameters associated with the mechanism.
In combination with the
MechanismType
class it is possible to create generic graphical interface
widgets that are independent of the particular mechanism and parameter names.
If vartype = 1, 2, or 3, the storage is for PARAMETER, ASSIGNED, or STATE
variables respectively. If vartype = 0, the storage is for all three types.
If vartype = -1, the count and names (and array size)
of the GLOBAL variables are accessible, but any other method will
generate an error message.
Example:
from
neuron
import
n
,
gui
ms1
=
n
.
MechanismStandard
(
'hh'
)
ms2
=

Example:
The following example provides a function
get_mech_globals
that returns a
list of all of a mechanism’s global (or per-thread-global) variables. As running the
code shows, there are six such variables (all per-thread-global) for the
hh
mechanism. These are used to temporarily share limiting values and time constant information
between functions in the NMODL file; their per-thread-global nature means that
the memory is reused for subsequent locations within a given thread, but that different
threads do not interfere with each other.
from
neuron
import
n

(
mechname
):
ms

mech_globals
.
append
(
name
[

])
return
mech_globals
print

get_mech_globals
(
'hh'
))
Warning
MechanismStandard only supports the names of mechanisms as strings, not the mechanism objects.
e.g., you can pass
'hh'
but not
n.hh
.
If you have a density mechanism, e.g.,
mech
=
n.hh
, beginning with NEURON 9, you can get
the name of the mechanism as a string with
mech.name
. You can then use this string
with MechanismStandard. For example:
from
neuron
import
n
mech
=
n
.
hh
ms
=
n
.

(
mech
